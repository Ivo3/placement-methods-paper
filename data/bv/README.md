We received the sequence data from Sujatha Srinivasan, 
and thus cannot publish them here.
Further information about the data, as well as the meta-data,
are available from the above online link.
Meta-data can be found in their Table S3

We here provide processed versions of the meta-data, which we used for our programs:

 * `meta_simple.csv`: Csv file with the meta-data per sample.
 * `sequence_names.csv`: Map between the shortend reference taxa name and their long form.
 
These files were the input to the respective programs in the `code` directory.
