Overview
-------------------------

This directory was set up to contain symlinks to the data directories
`bv`, `hmp`, and `tara`.
Those need to contain three directories: `chunks`, `filtered` and `maps`,
as produced by the `fasta_chunkify.cpp` genesis app.

When re-creating our analysis pipeline, this can be done in any other way.
We just keep this directory here for our own reference.
