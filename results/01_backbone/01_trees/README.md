Overview
-------------------------

This directory contains the constrained and unconstrained
trees `Archaea`, `Bacteria`, `Eukaryota` and `General`.
They were inferred using the alignments in `results/01_backbone/00_reference`.

Programs used for the tree inference: RAxML and Sativa.
Basic scripts for the inference are provided in each directory,
showing which settings were used for each run.
