You found the easter egg!

There is only one possible explanation of how you managed to achieve this:
You are so highly dedicated to looking into our results
(hopefully not in order to prove us wrong...),
that you even found this little file. Impressive!

As a reward, let me tell you a secret:
The original project name for the two papers that this repository is for was

    bacardi

which is short for

    Big Analysis of Clustering Approaches Running on Distributed Infrastructure
    
However, there seems to be some kind of spirit that shares that name [citation needed].
Not that we know anything about stuff like that...
Anyway, because this might have caused some trademark issues,
we removed all references to this from this repository (except this one).
You just dug up this old relict of the past!

I think, you finding this file deserves some recognition.
If you also think so, feel free to write me an email: luc@s-cze.ch
Maybe we find ourselves to be in the same town.
If so, we should have a Cuba Libre together ;-)
